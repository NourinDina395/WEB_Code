        <h2 id="early-life">Early Life</h2>

        <p>
  Nourin Mahmoda Dina was born on January 23rd, 2002, in Magura district, part of the Khulna Division in Bangladesh. She grew up in a peaceful rural village in Mohammadpur upazila, surrounded by green fields and a close-knit community. Her childhood was deeply influenced by traditional values, family support, and the tranquility of village life away from the busy city atmosphere.
</p>

<p>
  Coming from a middle-class family, Nourin was raised with a strong emphasis on integrity, education, and self-discipline. Her father, a local businessman, was a role model of honesty, while her mother, a caring homemaker, instilled in her empathy, patience, and strong moral principles. As the eldest daughter, Nourin took on household responsibilities early on, learning to balance her studies with family duties.
</p>

<p>
  From a young age, she was naturally curious and eager to learn. She often explored how things worked around her and excelled in mathematics and logical reasoning at Chalimia Government Primary School. Teachers described her as “quiet yet curious.” Her hobbies included gardening, cycling, swimming, and playing cricket with friends from her neighborhood.
</p>

<p>
  After primary school, Nourin attended Babukhali Government High School, where she continued to shine in science and mathematics. She took part in quiz contests and district science fairs. Excelling in her SSC exams, she secured admission to one of the top colleges in her district for higher secondary studies. It was during this time she discovered programming through textbooks and online tutorials, which ignited her passion for computer science.
</p>

<p>
  Nourin credits her upbringing in a calm, nurturing environment rich in community values and educational encouragement as the cornerstone of her academic dedication and personal development.
